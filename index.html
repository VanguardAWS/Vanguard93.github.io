            <h2>Autonoumous Underwater Vehicle Operator</h2>
            <p class="parallax-p">Once I left the Navy I worked for Oceaneering as an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) Operator. As an AUV Operator I undertook essential maintenance and ensured that, when on a mission, the AUVs were able to operate as intended, whether that be collecting marine life data for scientific research, detecting underwater hazards for military operations, or surveying the seabed and ocean environment for commercial purposes. AUV operators also operate the AUV, to include mission planning, mission sensor/payload operations, launching, remotely piloting, and recovering the underwater vehicle.</p>
